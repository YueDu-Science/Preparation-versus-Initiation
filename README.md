# Preparation-versus-Initiation

code-experiment: the code for reproducing exp.1 (the online sessions). Exp. 2 was similar to exp. 1 but used different revised mapping. Exp. 3 parallelled exp. 1 except for using different visual stimuli.

data: organized into table format (MATLAB). 
  - RawData: contains raw data
  - data-for-analysis: contains original data and derived speed-accuracy tradeoff function
  - Individual_Data: organized for model fitting.
  - model_fitting_individual: model fittig results.

Codes for modeling will be uploaded soon.
